 *       Customer media file management for orders
 *       
 *       **Overview:**
 *       Customer Media endpoints allow customers to upload, view, and manage media files associated with their orders. These files serve as supporting materials, requirements, references, or additional context for their orders.
 *       
 *       **File Types Supported:**
 *       - **Images**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF (for mockups, references, screenshots)
 *       - **Videos**: MP4, MOV, AVI (for demos, examples, tutorials)  
 *       - **Documents**: PDF (for detailed requirements, specifications)
 *       
 *       **Upload Constraints:**
 *       - Maximum 10 files per upload request
 *       - Individual file size limit: 5MB
 *       - Total upload size limit: 10MB per request
 *       - Files are stored securely in Cloudinary
 *       
 *       **Access Control:**
 *       - Customers can only access media for their own orders
 *       - ADMIN/STAFF can view all customer media files
 *       - Media upload is restricted to PENDING and IN_PROGRESS orders
 *       - Media deletion is only allowed for PENDING orders
 *       
 *       **Integration with Orders:**
 *       - Customer media files are separate from staff-uploaded media files
 *       - Customer media is always visible to the order owner
 *       - Staff media files are only shown when order status is COMPLETED
 *       - All media operations are logged in order history
 *       
 *       **Typical Workflow:**
 *       1. Customer creates an order
 *       2. Customer uploads supporting media files (requirements, references, etc.)
 *       3. Staff processes the order and may upload their own media files
 *       4. When order is completed, customer can view both their files and staff files
 *       5. Customer can delete their files only while order status is PENDING
 *       
 *       **Security Features:**
 *       - Files stored with obscured filenames in Cloudinary
 *       - Access controlled by JWT authentication
 *       - Ownership verification for all operations
 *       - Automatic cleanup on failed uploads
 *       - File type and size validation
